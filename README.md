# die_awesomium
A dummy dll which replaces awesomium




#how2install
Put everything from the dieawesomium folder into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod or if not on x64 C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod, or wherever you installed gmod.
Do the same with everything from the Textures folder.
If you want to, then you can also do it with dieawesomium_mcorerender for some more speed.

If asked to, click yes on every replace.
It should replace Awesomium.dll and some other stuff.
If not, check that you installed it to the right directory.

Incase it doesn't work out of the box ( crash with a MessageBox on startup ), try installing https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145 ( 32 bit aka x86 one ),
and then reinstall this.

If you're updating, make sure you delete the old files and verify the games integrity before doing so!
